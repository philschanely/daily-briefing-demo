Quote of the Day:

> “The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them.”
> *– Thomas Merton*

## 9. Exclusive: US government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman (CNN)

> “US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.
> “The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump.
> “A secret order authorized by the court that handles the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) began after Manafort became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014. It centered on work done by a group of Washington consulting firms for Ukraine's former ruling party, the sources told CNN.”

**Nick Note:** This information was leaked on the same day the NY Times reported that federal agents raided the home of Manafort and told him that special counsel Mueller planned to indict him. While this investigation continues, President Trump will speak before the UN General Assembly today. Yesterday, President Trump had bilateral meetings with President Macron of France. Watch Mr. Trump’s remarks before the meeting. But today, his remarks reportedly will center on North Korea and Iran before the entire assembly. The world will be watching just like the Creator of the world is always watching. North Korea’s known human rights violations and Iran’s known desire to want to eliminate Israel have not escaped the all-knowing eye of the Lord (Hebrews 4:13).


## 8. Hurricane Maria Does ‘Mind Boggling’ Damage to Dominica, Leader Says (NY Times)

> “The Caribbean island nation of Dominica sustained “mind boggling” damage from Hurricane Maria, its prime minister said on Tuesday, after the storm hit with maximum sustained winds of nearly 160 miles per hour that ripped roofs off buildings, including his own home.
> “There was no immediate word of deaths or injuries on the island from Maria, the third in a string of devastating hurricanes to sweep through the region in recent weeks.
> “The National Hurricane Center said just after 5 a.m. that the storm, now moving away from Dominica, had regained Category 5 strength, after briefly dropping to Category 4. It is expected to remain “extremely dangerous” as it approaches the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday night and Wednesday, the center said.”

**Nick Note:** Would you consider pulling away to pray for those in the path of Maria? Specifically, I’m praying that God would protect people and compel helpers (2 Thessalonians 3:3, 2 Corinthians 5:14)? John Bunyan is right: “You have not lived today until you have done something for someone who can never repay you.”


7. Pediatricians may view tattoos, piercings as red flags. They should discuss it instead, report says (LA Times)
“Physicians who came across an inked symbol or a navel ring while examining an adolescent or young adult were taught to probe for other dangerous behaviors, including drug use, weapons carrying, risky sexual activity, and self-injury.
“On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued its first-ever clinical guidelines to members on tattooing, piercing and scarification in adolescents and young adults.
“Body modification is quickly becoming commonplace, and the kids who engage in it are more than likely normal, healthy kids expressing themselves in ways that need not raise concerns.
“Tattooing and piercing of various body parts no longer is a high-risk population phenomenon, as evidenced by growing numbers of adults and adolescents not considered at risk who have tattoos and multiple ear and body piercings,” says the new report.”

Nick Note: Do you have a tattoo? I have a birthmark, a few pimples, and a strong aversion to needles. Approximately 38 percent of millennials report having a tattoo. A 2016 poll found that 86 percent of adults who have gotten a tattoo don’t regret it. The Old Testament speaks to tattoos (Leviticus 19:28, Deuteronomy 14:2) but when considering the context, these verses appear to be addressing scarification (good luck measures). Should Christians get tattoos? “Whatever you eat or drink, whatever you do, do all for the glory of God. (1 Corinthians 10:31)”

6. Too close for comfort: How social media changed how we talk to (and about) each other in America (Yahoo)
“Social media has, by design, fundamentally reshaped how we have conversations with each other, moving casual speech from the auditory ether to the realm of the written. And it has vastly expanded the audience for conversations that used to happen in small communities of relatively similar people, replacing them with one-to-many interactions with people who potentially have a wide array of views, and weak or even no direct personal ties.
“No longer are we merely holding opinions different from one another; we’re also holding different facts. Increasingly our arguments aren’t over what we should be doing … but instead over what is happening.” The new fights would be over “competing visions of reality,” he predicted, correctly.
“Research suggests the best solutions for improving discourse may come from getting to know each other as whole people instead of just opinions — something Facebook may be uniquely suited to do. If we connect with people about what we have in common — sports teams, TV shows, interests — it is easier to have dialogue about what we disagree on.”

Nick Note: The Black Crowes Talk to Angels but I may have unleashed my inner demons when discussing certain issues over social media (and I don’t think I’m alone). More than half of the American population regret something they posted or said on social media. “Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry. (James 1:19)”

5. Your Next New Best Friend Might Be a Robot (Nautilus)
“When Xiaoice was released for a public test on WeChat (a popular messaging and calling app in China) on May 29 of last year, she received 1.5 million chat group invitations in the first 72 hours. Many people said that they didn’t realize she isn’t a human until 10 minutes into their conversation.
“Today, she has had more than 10 billion conversations with people, most of them about private matters. Six million have posted their conversation on social media…One of its surprising conclusions is that people don’t necessarily care that they’re chatting with a machine. Many see Xiaoice as a partner and friend, and are willing to confide in her just as they do with their human friends. Xiaoice is teaching us what makes a relationship feel human, and hinting at a new goal for artificial intelligence: not just analyzing databases and driving cars, but making people happier.”

Nick Note: Garth Brooks has Friends in Low Places and many of you have Friends in Cyber Spaces. 20 years ago, the average American had three friends. Today, that number stands at 1.6. In 2004, 25 percent of people said they had no close friend to discuss important matters. That number was 10 percent in 1985. 1 out of 2 people don’t know their neighbors’ names.
Today, we are witnessing the initial effects of the loneliness epidemic. Look no further than movies like Her and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty to see this played out on the big screen.  This is a growing problem and a glorious opportunity for the church to be the church (Hebrews 10:24-25, Romans 12:13, 1 Peter 4:9, Hebrews 13:2).

4. What’s the Best Way to Take an Afternoon Nap? (WSJ)
“Dr. Dinges, who is also a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, says that naps actually come in two forms: voluntary and involuntary. A voluntary nap is where a person makes a conscious decision to catch some relief before continuing her day.
“These involuntary sleep attacks don’t provide much benefit, because “the brain doesn’t progress into sleep far enough for recovery, so it’s more like a disturbed night of sleep,” Dr. Dinges says. 
“Studies have shown that work hours and commute times are the two largest sources of sleep debt for Americans, Dr. Dinges says…Humans are biologically programmed to sleep at night, and to take a nap in the midafternoon, though scientists aren’t sure why. “There is no melatonin triggering the sleep, it just seems to be this harmonic phenomenon,” Dr. Dinges says.”

Nick Note: Do you ever dream of having a set-up like George Costanza? Research indicates one-third of U.S. adults nap on a typical day. Americans currently average 6.8 hours of sleep at night, down more than an hour from 1942. 40 million people in the United States suffer from chronic long-term sleep disorders each year. The Scriptures encourage rest but also a hearty work-ethic (Mark 2:27, Colossians 3:23). Perhaps the best way is the right way – a candid conversation with your supervisor (Ephesians 6:5). So Dr. Wright….

3. Is it All Downhill from 35? (BBC)
“Not only is 35 the age when we’re perceived to no longer be "young", according to a study from the University of Kent, but also when men reach "peak loneliness" and women hit "peak boring." And if that wasn’t bad enough, 35 is also the age at which we start hating our jobs, according to a survey of more than 2,000 UK employees by human resources company Robert Half.
“Research suggests it’s during your mid-thirties that family pressure and increased financial responsibility conflate causing problems both at work and home…Job security also becomes more of an issue. In the first quarter of 2017, UK workers aged 35-49 were twice as likely to be made redundant as those aged 25-34, according to data from the Office for National Statistics… one in six British workers over the age of 35 were unhappy in their job – more than double the figure for those under 35.”

Nick Note: Don’t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow? Sorry, Fleetwood Mac, but The Boss is right in reminiscing on Glory Days according to this research. But are our best days really behind us? In the Scriptures, we are guaranteed trouble in the present but glory in the future (Romans 8:18, John 16:33, 1 Peter 4:12, 2 Timothy 3:12). Our story ends in a place where there is the fullness of joy, no tears, and an epic party with our Father (Psalm 16:11, Revelation 21:4, 19:6-9).

2. Loving swan reunites with partner, and it's magical

Nick Note: Watch it here. This reminds me of one of my favorite passages in the Scriptures: “Come now, my love, my lovely one come; for behold, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone… Let me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely. (Song of Songs 2:10, 14)”

1. This Might Be the Worst Congressional Campaign Ad Ever (The Daily Beast)
“Whoever told House Democratic candidate Dan Helmer this ad was a great idea should reevaluate whether negative attention could be considered good attention.”

Nick Note: Watch it here. Is there really no such thing as bad publicity? Watch this Christopher Knight campaign ad and you tell me. In the Scriptures, we read of a God that can communicate his good and glorious message through less than desirable means (Luke 19:40, Numbers 22).
